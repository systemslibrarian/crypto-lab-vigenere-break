/**
 * Known WCAG 1.4.11 / generated-content findings in this lab, captured through
 * the gate's own path so the baseline and the check cannot disagree.
 *
 * THIS FILE IS A TO-DO LIST, NOT A SET OF EXEMPTIONS. The gate ratchets on it:
 *   - a finding NOT listed here fails the run, so a regression cannot land;
 *   - a listed finding whose ratio gets WORSE fails, so the list cannot rot;
 *   - a listed finding that no longer appears ALSO fails, so a fixed entry must
 *     be deleted and the file can only shrink toward empty.
 * The last rule is what stops an allowlist becoming a permanent exemption.
 *
 * `unverified: true` marks an absolutely-positioned pseudo-element. It can paint
 * outside its host and the oracle measures it against the host's backdrop, so
 * that ratio is NOT trustworthy — hand-measure before acting on it.
 *
 * What the live oracle finds, over {dark, light} x {1280, 380} and every state
 * the drive builds, is exactly these two — both in the SHARED Crypto Lab top
 * bar, and neither one this repo's to fix.
 *
 * `.cl-btn` draws its edge as
 * `1px solid color-mix(in srgb, var(--accent, #35d6bb) 38%, transparent)` over
 * the bar's fixed `#0b1512`. This lab DOES define `--accent` (#7e57c2, the
 * historical-wing violet, the same value in both themes so the always-dark bar
 * tints correctly), so the composited edge is the violet mix rather than the
 * fleet-default teal: 1.49:1 against the bar, IDENTICALLY IN BOTH THEMES,
 * because the bar is always dark and the theme does not move it. The markup and
 * CSS are a byte-identical copy carried by every repo in the fleet, and
 * `CLAUDE.md` is explicit that a change every lab should get is a reviewed
 * fleet-wide pass and never an overwrite driven from one repo. So it is
 * measured here, ratcheted here, and reported upward.
 *
 * Everything inside `<main id="app">`, the hero and the footer is audited with
 * no exemption, and — after this pass — comes back clean.
